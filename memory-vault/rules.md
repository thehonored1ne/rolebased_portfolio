# System Rules & Anti-Patterns

## Hard Guardrails

- **Windows Path Handling**: Always use forward slashes (`/`) or escaped backslashes in script paths and command strings.
- **Dependency Minimalization**: Do not introduce heavy dependencies when standard library or native tools suffice.
- **Memory Recency**: Check `INDEX.md` or run `memory.py recall` before executing any multi-step task.
- **Concise Outputs**: Do not repeat explanations; keep answers, logs, and memory entries atomic and focused.

## Laravel Rules

- **Cache Clearing**: Run `php artisan optimize:clear` after editing `.env` or configuration.
- **Validation**: Prefer FormRequest classes over inline controller validation.
